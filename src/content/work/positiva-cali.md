Static website designed for a side project. It was based on the first advertising concept on advertising school that I build. Years later,  now, it's a spot to deliver and spread positive news and notes with ever green focus, creating a holistic well-being experience.

Builded with Hugo framework, forked from Lightbi frame. Some features that I'd use for this production are Sass, Cypress, Theme Toggle, Bootstrap Icons, Multilingual support and more. For this project I'd use Chat GPT to generate content. Here the **Abstract**:
